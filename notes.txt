## Sequelize Naming Convention
  -  model name should be singular
  - Taable name should be plural

## what is the use of migration folder
  -  so migration folder help us to understand when these table are created
  - what properties & constraints we added at database level.
  - These migration file is usefull in incremental development.

  ''' What does migration mean ??

      Just like you use version control systems such as Git to
      manage changes in your source code, you can use migrations to keep
      track of changes to the database.
      With migrations you can transfer your existing database into another
      state and vice versa: Those state transitions are saved in migration files,
      which describe how to get to the new state and how to revert the changes
      in order to get back to the old state.

    => A Migration in Sequelize is a javascript file which exports two functions,
      up and down, that dictates how to perform the migration and undo it
  ''' 

  - Async up is use for creating tabel
  - Async down is use for deletion.

=> step -1
# how to generate model (make sure to run this cmd inside models parent directory).
  - "npx sequelize model:genrate --name (table_name) --attributes name:String"

=> step - 2
# "npx sequelize db:migrate" will applie all migration on the database.
  # it will create two table sequelize-meta and your table

#if you want to rollback then run : "npx sequelize db:migrate:undo"
